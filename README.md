# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview:

Bobby and I have been given two assignments by his manager: to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. My report will summarize my analysis and help Bobby's manager for the "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age. 

## Results:

### Deliverable 1:

In the first deliverable, I created a table called 'Retirement Titles' which holds all the titles of employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. After removing duplicate entries for some employees because they have switched titles over the years, I cleaned the data to keep only the most recent title of each employee.

Based on the number of titles, I created a 'Retiring Titles' table which grouped the titles of the retiring employees and thier count. It helped provide a clear picture as to which unique positions will need to be filled in the future. See below:

### Deliverable 2:

In the second deliverable, I created a mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

Upon reviewing the results of the first two deliverables, it is apparent that the Pewlett-Hackard management will have to prepare for an upcoming "silver tsunami" as more and more positions become vacant due to employees retiring:

*. The highest number of vacancies will be in the Senior Engineering positions with 25,916 positions opening.

*.  The 24,926 Senior Staff positions are also expected to open up, followed by more Engineers, other staff, Technique Leaders,           Assistant Engineers and a couple managers.

*.  According to the Mentorship Eligibility table, employees born in 1965 alone gives us about 1549 potential mentors who can train       incoming staff.
    
*.  The least turnover is expected in the management position, which is good news as it allows managers to prepare by hiring and 
    training existing and new employees to fill those upcoming vacant positions, many of which are senior positions.
    
    
## SUMMARY:




Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
